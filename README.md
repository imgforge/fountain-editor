# Fountain Editor

Fountain Editor is a simple browser tool that allows you to preview your Fountain project as you work on it. This is helpful for making sure you get the styling right, and quickly playing around with different styles.

Fountain Editor currently supports the following features:
* Drag and drop uploading.
* Live preview of the converted PDF.
* Saving (downloading) edited Fountain files.

Fountain Editor uses [fountain.js](https://github.com/mattdaly/Fountain.js) in order to parse the Fountain files. The application itself was built off of the fountain.js sample application, so huge thanks to by [Matt Daly](https://github.com/mattdaly)!

For more information about Fountain, check out fountain.io.
